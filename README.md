Case Study: Git Workflow
---------------------------
📌 Project Overview

This case study focuses on designing an effective Git Workflow for product releases. As a DevOps Architect at Zendrix Softwares, you need to implement a structured Git branching model to streamline the release process. The company follows a monthly release cycle, with updates going live on the 25th of every month.

🎯 Problem Statement
-----------------------
The company struggles with managing product releases efficiently.

A well-defined Git Workflow is required to ensure smooth development, testing, and deployment.

The workflow should support feature development, bug fixes, and hotfixes while maintaining stability in production.

Your objective is to:
-------------------------
Define a Git Workflow Architecture suitable for monthly releases.

Simulate the workflow by creating pseudo-code files and branches.

Upload the repository to GitHub and provide a solution link.

🛠 Proposed Git Workflow
--------------------------
1️⃣ Branching Strategy

The workflow follows a Gitflow model with the following branches:

master → Stable production code.

develop → Latest development changes (merged features and fixes).

feature/ → Individual branches for new features.

release/ → Pre-release testing and bug fixes before deployment.

hotfix/ → Critical fixes applied directly to production.

2️⃣ Implementation Steps

Step 1: Initialize Repository and Create Branches

# Initialize Git repository
git init git-workflow-case-study
cd git-workflow-case-study

git branch master   # Production branch
git branch develop  # Main development branch
git branch release  # Pre-release branch

Step 2: Feature Development Workflow

# Create a feature branch from develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
# Add changes, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

Step 3: Merging Features into Develop

git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin develop

Step 4: Preparing for Release

# Create a release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0 develop
# Final bug fixes and testing
git add .
git commit -m "Final fixes for v1.0"
git push origin release/v1.0

Step 5: Merging Release to Master and Deploying

git checkout master
git merge release/v1.0
git tag v1.0

git push origin master --tags

Step 6: Hotfixes (If Required)

# Create a hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix master
# Apply fix, commit, and merge
git add .
git commit -m "Urgent security fix"
git checkout master
git merge hotfix/urgent-fix

git push origin master

📂 Repository Structure

git-workflow-case-study/

│── feature/
│   ├── new-feature.txt
│── release/
│   ├── release-v1.0.txt
│── hotfix/
│   ├── urgent-fix.txt
│── README.md (this file)

🚀 Final Outcome

A structured Git Workflow to manage monthly releases effectively.

Organized feature, release, and hotfix branches for better collaboration.

A simulated repository uploaded to GitHub.

📝 Conclusion

This case study demonstrates the Gitflow branching model, ensuring a stable release process while allowing continuous development. Implementing this workflow helps in structured version control and efficient software deployment.
